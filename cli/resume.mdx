description: Resume a previous interactive Codex session
---

The `resume` command allows you to continue a previous interactive Codex session, preserving the full conversation history and context.

## Usage

```bash
codex resume              # Shows picker to select session
codex resume --last       # Resume most recent session
```

## Description

Resume lets you pick up where you left off with a previous Codex session. The full conversation history, including:
- User messages
- Agent responses
- Executed commands
- File changes
- Reasoning and plans

All of this context is restored, allowing you to continue the conversation naturally.

## Options

<ParamField path="--last" type="boolean">
  Resume the most recent session without showing the picker.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Interactive Picker

Show a picker to select from your previous sessions:

```bash
codex resume
```

This displays a list of recent sessions with:
- Session date and time
- Initial prompt or topic
- Number of turns

### Resume Latest

Automatically resume your most recent session:

```bash
codex resume --last
```

## How It Works

1. Codex loads the session rollout file from `~/.codex/sessions/`
2. Restores the full conversation history
3. Reopens the interactive TUI
4. You can continue the conversation from where you left off

## Use Cases

- **Long-running tasks**: Resume work on multi-step implementations
- **Context preservation**: Keep the agent's understanding of your project
- **Incremental development**: Build features across multiple sessions
- **Review and iterate**: Review previous changes and make adjustments
