---

The `features` command allows you to view, enable, and disable experimental and beta features in Codex.

## Usage

```bash
codex features <SUBCOMMAND>
```

## Subcommands

### list

List all available feature flags with their current state:

```bash
codex features list
```

### enable

Enable a specific feature flag:

```bash
codex features enable <FEATURE_NAME>
```

### disable

Disable a specific feature flag:

```bash
codex features disable <FEATURE_NAME>
```

## Examples

### View All Features

```bash
codex features list
```

Output shows:
- Feature name
- Current state (enabled/disabled)
- Stage (stable, beta, experimental, under development)
- Description

### Enable Experimental Feature

```bash
codex features enable js_repl
```

### Disable Feature

```bash
codex features disable multi_agent
```

### Use Feature for Single Command

Instead of permanently enabling a feature, use the `--enable` flag:

```bash
codex --enable js_repl exec "run this code in a REPL"
```

## Feature Stages

Features go through different stages of development:

| Stage | Description | Stability |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **stable** | Production-ready, enabled by default | High |
| **beta** | Generally stable, ready for testing | Medium |
| **experimental** | Early development, may change | Low |
| **under development** | Not ready for use | Very low |
| **deprecated** | Being phased out | N/A |

## Common Features

### Experimental Features

- `js_repl` - JavaScript REPL environment
- `multi_agent` - Multi-agent collaboration
- `apps` - ChatGPT apps integration
- `prevent_idle_sleep` - Prevent system sleep during long operations

### Stable Features

- `shell_tool` - Enhanced shell command execution
- `unified_exec` - Unified execution engine
- `shell_snapshot` - Shell command snapshots
- `sqlite` - SQLite-backed state storage
- `personality` - Agent personality customization

## Configuration

Feature flags can also be set in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
js_repl = true
multi_agent = false
```

## Priority Order

Feature flags are resolved in this order (highest to lowest):

1. Command-line flags (`--enable`, `--disable`)
2. Environment variables (`CODEX_ENABLE_<FEATURE>`)
3. Config file (`~/.codex/config.toml`)
4. Default value

## Warnings

<Warning>
  Experimental features may:
  - Change behavior without notice
  - Be removed in future versions
  - Cause unexpected errors
  - Affect performance
</Warning>

<Note>
  Beta features are more stable but may still undergo breaking changes before becoming stable.
