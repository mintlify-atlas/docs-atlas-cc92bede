description: Fork a previous interactive session to explore alternative approaches
---

The `fork` command creates a new session based on an existing one, allowing you to explore different approaches while preserving the original conversation.

## Usage

```bash
codex fork              # Shows picker to select session to fork
codex fork --last       # Fork most recent session
```

## Description

Forking creates a copy of a previous session's history and starts a new interactive session from that point. This is useful when you want to:

- Try a different approach to solving a problem
- Explore alternative implementations
- Experiment without affecting the original session
- Branch off from a specific point in a conversation

The fork creates a new thread ID with the copied history, leaving the original session unchanged.

## Options

<ParamField path="--last" type="boolean">
  Fork the most recent session without showing the picker.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Interactive Picker

Show a picker to select which session to fork:

```bash
codex fork
```

### Fork Latest

Automatically fork your most recent session:

```bash
codex fork --last
```

## How It Works

1. Codex loads the selected session's history
2. Creates a new thread ID
3. Copies all conversation history to the new thread
4. Opens the interactive TUI with the forked session
5. You can now continue in a different direction

## Use Cases

- **A/B testing approaches**: Try two different solutions to the same problem
- **Experimentation**: Test ideas without losing your original work
- **Decision points**: Fork when you reach a critical architectural choice
- **Learning**: Explore "what if" scenarios with the same context
