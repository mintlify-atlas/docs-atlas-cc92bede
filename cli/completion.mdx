description: Generate shell completion scripts for Codex CLI
---

The `completion` command generates shell completion scripts that enable tab-completion for Codex commands, subcommands, and flags.

## Usage

```bash
codex completion [SHELL]
```

## Supported Shells

- `bash` (default)
- `zsh`
- `fish`
- `powershell`
- `elvish`

## Installation

### Bash

Add to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(codex completion bash)"
```

Or generate to a file:

```bash
codex completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/codex
```

### Zsh

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(codex completion zsh)"
```

Or generate to a file:

```bash
codex completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_codex
```

Make sure `~/.zsh/completions` is in your `$fpath`:

```bash
fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
```

### Fish

Generate to Fish's completions directory:

```bash
codex completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/codex.fish
```

### PowerShell

Add to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
codex completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Examples

### Generate Bash Completions

```bash
codex completion bash
```

### Generate for Specific Shell

```bash
codex completion zsh
codex completion fish
```

### Save to File

```bash
codex completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/codex
```

## What Gets Completed

Shell completion works for:
- Commands: `codex <TAB>` shows all available commands
- Subcommands: `codex mcp <TAB>` shows MCP subcommands
- Flags: `codex --<TAB>` shows all global flags
- Options: `codex -m <TAB>` suggests model names

## Troubleshooting

### Completions Not Working

1. Make sure you've reloaded your shell:
   ```bash
   exec $SHELL
   ```

2. Verify the completion file is in the right location:
   ```bash
   # Bash
   echo $BASH_COMPLETION_USER_DIR
   
   # Zsh
   echo $fpath
   ```

3. Check that the completion function is loaded:
   ```bash
   # Bash
   complete -p codex
   
   # Zsh
   which _codex
   ```
