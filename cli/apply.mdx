description: Apply the latest diff produced by Codex agent to your local working tree
---

The `apply` command takes the most recent diff generated by the Codex agent and applies it to your local working tree using `git apply`.

## Usage

```bash
codex apply
codex a  # Short alias
```

## Description

When Codex generates code changes during an interactive session, it produces a diff that can be applied to your files. The `apply` command:

1. Finds the latest diff from your most recent Codex session
2. Applies it to your local working tree using `git apply`
3. Reports any conflicts or issues

This is useful when you want to:
- Apply changes after reviewing them in the TUI
- Quickly accept Codex's proposed changes
- Integrate Codex changes into your current work

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Apply the latest diff from your most recent session:

```bash
codex apply
```

Using the short alias:

```bash
codex a
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Diff applied successfully
- `1` - Error applying diff (conflicts, file not found, etc.)
