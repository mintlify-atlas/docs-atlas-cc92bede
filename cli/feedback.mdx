## Example Bug Report

```markdown
# codex exec fails with "Invalid API key" despite valid key

## Environment
- Codex version: 0.5.0
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Shell: bash 5.1.16

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run: `echo "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | codex login --with-api-key`
2. Verify: `codex login status` (shows authenticated)
3. Run: `codex exec "explain main.rs"`
4. Error: "Invalid API key"

## Expected Behavior
Should execute the prompt using the stored API key

## Actual Behavior
Fails with "Invalid API key" error

## Logs
```
[stderr output here]
```

## Config
```toml
[relevant config.toml sections]
```
```

## Example Feature Request

```markdown
# Add support for output templates in codex exec

## Use Case
I frequently run `codex exec` in CI to generate reports. I want the output
to follow a consistent template format (e.g., markdown, HTML, JSON).

## Current Workaround
I provide template instructions in every prompt:
```bash
codex exec "analyze code quality. Format as markdown with sections:
## Summary
## Issues Found
## Recommendations"
```

This is repetitive and error-prone.

## Proposed Solution
Add a `--template` flag:
```bash
codex exec --template quality-report.md "analyze code quality"
```

Where `quality-report.md` contains:
```markdown
# Code Quality Report

## Summary
{{summary}}

## Issues Found
{{issues}}

## Recommendations
{{recommendations}}
```

## Examples
```bash
codex exec --template report.md "analyze security"
codex exec --template api-docs.json "document API endpoints"
```
```
