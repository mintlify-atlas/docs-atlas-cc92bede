# Introduction to Codex CLI

Codex CLI is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer. It brings ChatGPT-level reasoning with the power to execute code, manipulate files, and iterate — all under version control.

## What is Codex CLI?

Codex CLI is built for developers who live in the terminal and want ChatGPT-level reasoning with the ability to execute code, manipulate files, and iterate. It's chat-driven development that understands and executes your repo.

## Why use Codex CLI?

Codex CLI is designed for developers who already work in the terminal and want powerful AI assistance without leaving their workflow.

### Key features

**Zero setup**

Bring your OpenAI API key or sign in with ChatGPT and it just works. No complex configuration required.

**Safe and secure**

Codex runs in a sandbox with network disabled and directory restrictions. Full auto-approval is safe because commands are isolated from your system.

**Full auto-approval**

Let Codex work autonomously while staying secure. In full auto mode, commands run network-disabled and directory-sandboxed.

**Multimodal**

Pass in screenshots or diagrams to implement features. Codex understands visual context.

**Open source**

Fully open source so you can see how it works and contribute to development.

## How it works

Codex CLI operates in three approval modes, giving you control over how much autonomy the agent has:

- **Suggest** (default): Codex reads files and suggests changes. You approve all file writes and shell commands.
- **Auto Edit**: Codex reads and writes files automatically. You approve shell commands.
- **Full Auto**: Codex reads, writes files, and executes commands. All operations run in a sandbox with network disabled.

<Note>
In full auto mode, every command runs network-disabled and confined to your working directory for defense-in-depth. Codex will warn you if you start in auto modes without Git tracking.
</Note>

## Example use cases

<CodeGroup>
```bash Refactor code
codex "Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks"
```

```bash Generate migrations
codex "Generate SQL migrations for adding a users table"
```

```bash Write tests
codex "Write unit tests for utils/date.ts"
```

```bash Create an app
codex --approval-mode full-auto "create a fancy todo-list app"
```
</CodeGroup>

Codex rewrites code, runs tests, generates files, and iterates until the task is complete.
