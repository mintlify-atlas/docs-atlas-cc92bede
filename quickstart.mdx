# Quickstart

This guide will help you get Codex CLI running and execute your first commands. You'll go from installation to your first AI-powered task in just a few minutes.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- Codex CLI installed (see [Installation](/installation))
- A ChatGPT account (Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise) or an OpenAI API key
- A terminal running macOS 12+, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), or Windows 11 with WSL2

## Get started with Codex

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Codex CLI">
    Install Codex globally using npm or Homebrew:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    ```

    ```bash Homebrew
    brew install --cask codex
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    codex --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in with ChatGPT">
    Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. This is the recommended method for using Codex with your ChatGPT plan.

    ```bash
    codex
    ```

    When you run this command, Codex will:
    1. Start a local login server on `http://localhost` (random port)
    2. Open your browser to authenticate
    3. Complete authentication and return to the terminal

    <Note>
    We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).
    </Note>

    **On a remote or headless machine?** Use device code authentication instead:

    ```bash
    codex login --device-auth
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use an API key (see [Authentication](/authentication) for details).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first command">
    Once authenticated, run Codex interactively:

    ```bash
    codex
    ```

    Or provide a prompt directly:

    ```bash
    codex "explain this codebase to me"
    ```

    Codex will analyze your project and provide an explanation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try an example task">
    Let's have Codex write a simple script. Try this command:

    ```bash
    codex "create a simple Python script that prints Hello World"
    ```

    Codex will:
    1. Create a Python file
    2. Write the code
    3. Ask for your approval before saving (in default "suggest" mode)
    4. Show you the result

    You'll see output similar to:

    ```
    I'll create a simple Python script for you.

    [Codex proposes changes]

    Approve? [Y/n]:
    ```

    Type `y` to approve and apply the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding approval modes

Codex operates in three approval modes that control how much autonomy the agent has:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Suggest" icon="hand">
    **Default mode**

    Codex reads files and suggests changes. You approve all file writes and shell commands.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto Edit" icon="pen-to-square">
    Codex reads and writes files automatically. You approve shell commands.

    Use: `codex --approval-mode auto-edit`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Auto" icon="robot">
    Codex reads, writes files, and executes commands autonomously. Everything runs in a sandbox.

    Use: `codex --approval-mode full-auto`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
In full auto mode, commands run network-disabled and confined to your working directory. Codex will warn you if your directory is not tracked by Git.
</Warning>

## Example workflows

Here are some common tasks you can ask Codex to perform:

<Accordion title="Refactor code">
  ```bash
  codex "Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks"
  ```

  Codex will:
  - Read the component file
  - Rewrite it using React Hooks
  - Run tests to verify the changes
  - Show you a diff of the changes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generate tests">
  ```bash
  codex "Write unit tests for utils/date.ts"
  ```

  Codex will:
  - Analyze the `date.ts` file
  - Generate comprehensive unit tests
  - Execute the tests
  - Iterate until they pass
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a full application">
  ```bash
  codex --approval-mode full-auto "create a todo-list app with React and TypeScript"
  ```

  Codex will:
  - Scaffold the project structure
  - Install dependencies
  - Write the application code
  - Run it in the sandbox
  - Show you the live result
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fix errors">
  ```bash
  codex "fix all TypeScript errors in this project"
  ```

  Codex will:
  - Run the TypeScript compiler
  - Identify all type errors
  - Fix them one by one
  - Verify the fixes compile
</Accordion>

## Interactive vs non-interactive mode

**Interactive mode** (default)

Run `codex` to start an interactive REPL session:

```bash
codex
```

You can have a back-and-forth conversation with Codex, approve changes, and iterate on tasks.

**Non-interactive mode**

Provide a prompt as a command-line argument:

```bash
codex "create a README for this project"
```

Codex will execute the task and exit when complete.

**Quiet mode** (for CI/CD)

Run Codex headless in pipelines:

```bash
codex -q "update CHANGELOG for next release"
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export CODEX_QUIET_MODE=1
```

## Passing images

Codex is multimodal and can understand images. Pass screenshots or diagrams:

```bash
codex -i screenshot.png "implement this design"
```

Codex will analyze the image and implement the visual design.
