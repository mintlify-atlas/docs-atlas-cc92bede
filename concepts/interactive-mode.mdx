title: Interactive mode
description: Use the Codex TUI for real-time AI assistance
---

Interactive mode provides a rich terminal user interface (TUI) for working with Codex. Launch it by running `codex` with or without an initial prompt.

## Starting interactive mode

<CodeGroup>
```bash Start with prompt
codex "add unit tests for the auth module"
```

```bash Start without prompt
codex
```

```bash With images
codex --image screenshot.png "explain this error"
```

```bash With configuration
codex --sandbox workspace-write --model gpt-5.2-codex "run the test suite"
```
</CodeGroup>

## TUI overview

The interactive interface consists of several key areas:

### Main conversation view

The primary area displays:
- **User messages** - Your prompts and inputs
- **Agent messages** - Responses from Codex
- **Command execution** - Shell commands with live output
- **File changes** - Diffs and modifications
- **Reasoning** - Internal agent reasoning (when available)

Content streams in real-time as the agent works, providing immediate feedback.

### Status bar

The bottom status bar shows:
- Current model and provider
- Sandbox mode and approval policy
- Working directory
- Network status
- Token usage for the current turn

### Input composer

The input area at the bottom allows you to:
- Type multi-line messages (Shift+Enter for newlines)
- Attach images with `--image` or drag-and-drop
- Invoke skills with `$skill-name`
- Reference apps with `$app-name`

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation or exit |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit Codex (when input is empty) |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate command history |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll conversation |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to start/end of input |

### Input control

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert newline |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear current line |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word backward |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete (when available) |

### Advanced

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+R` | Resume previous session |
| `Ctrl+P` | Open command palette (if enabled) |
| `Esc` | Cancel current input |

<Note>
  Keyboard shortcuts may vary slightly by terminal emulator and operating system.

## Features

### Live streaming output

Commands and agent messages stream in real-time. You'll see:
- Text appearing character-by-character
- Command output as it's generated
- Diffs as files are modified
- Progress indicators for long operations

### Approval prompts

When the agent needs to perform sensitive operations, you'll see an inline approval prompt:

```
┌─ Command Approval Required ────────────────────────────────┐
│ codex wants to run:                                        │
│   npm install express                                      │
│                                                            │
│ Working directory: /Users/me/project                       │
│                                                            │
│ [a] Accept once                                            │
│ [s] Accept for session                                     │
│ [p] Accept and add to policy                               │
│ [d] Decline                                                │
│ [c] Cancel turn                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Command history

Use the up/down arrow keys to cycle through:
- Previous prompts in this session
- Previously executed commands
- Resumed conversation inputs

History persists across sessions.

### Session management

Interactive mode automatically:
- Saves your conversation to disk
- Maintains context across turns
- Allows resuming from where you left off

Threads are stored in `~/.codex/sessions/` as JSONL files.

## Display options

### Alternate screen mode

By default, Codex uses the alternate screen buffer (like `vim` or `less`). This:
- Preserves your terminal scrollback
- Cleans up when you exit
- Works well in most terminals

To disable alternate screen mode:

```bash
codex --no-alt-screen
```

This is useful for terminal multiplexers like Zellij that strictly follow xterm specs.

### Color output

The TUI automatically detects your terminal's color support and adapts:
- 24-bit true color (recommended)
- 256 colors
- 16 colors (fallback)

Colors are used to highlight:
- Syntax in code blocks
- Diff additions (green) and deletions (red)
- Status indicators
- Error messages

## Working with images

Attach images to your prompts for visual context:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Command line
codex --image screenshot.png "what's wrong with this UI?"
```

```bash Multiple images
codex --image fig1.png,fig2.png,chart.jpg "compare these visualizations"
```
</CodeGroup>

Supported formats:
- PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- Local file paths
- Data URLs (via app-server)

## Advanced usage

### Resume sessions

Return to a previous conversation:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Resume last session
codex resume --last
```

```bash Resume by ID
codex resume thr_abc123
```

```bash Resume with new prompt
codex resume --last "continue the refactoring"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Fork conversations

Create a new branch from an existing thread:

```bash
codex fork thr_abc123
```

This copies the conversation history into a new thread, allowing you to explore alternative approaches.

### Custom working directory

Change the agent's working directory:

```bash
codex --cd /path/to/project
```

All file operations and commands will execute relative to this directory.

### Configuration profiles

Use predefined configuration profiles:

```bash
codex --profile production
```

Profiles are defined in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Troubleshooting

### Screen rendering issues

If you see garbled output or rendering glitches:

1. Try disabling alternate screen mode:
   ```bash
   codex --no-alt-screen
   ```

2. Check your `TERM` environment variable:
   ```bash
   echo $TERM  # Should be xterm-256color or similar
   ```

3. Update your terminal emulator to the latest version

### Input not working

If keyboard input seems unresponsive:

- Ensure your terminal supports the required features
- Check that no other process is capturing input
- Try restarting your terminal emulator

### Performance issues

If the TUI feels sluggish:

- Large conversation histories can slow rendering
- Consider starting a new thread for unrelated tasks
- Archive old threads to keep your session list manageable

<Warning>
  The TUI requires a minimum terminal size of 80x24 characters. Smaller terminals may not render correctly.
</Warning>
