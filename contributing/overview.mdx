Welcome to the Codex CLI contributing guide! We're building Codex in the open with the community and value your input.

## Contribution Policy

<Warning>
  **External contributions are by invitation only**
  
  At this time, the Codex team does not accept unsolicited code contributions. Pull requests that have not been explicitly invited by a member of the Codex team will be closed without review.
</Warning>

### How You Can Help

While we don't accept unsolicited PRs, there are many ways to contribute:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Report Bugs" icon="bug">
    Open a bug report or verify that an existing report already covers the issue you encountered.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Share Analysis" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Contribute reproduction details, root-cause hypotheses, or high-level fix outlines in issue threads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Propose Features" icon="lightbulb">
    Open an issue describing your proposal or upvote existing enhancement requests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Join Discussions" icon="comments">
    Participate in GitHub Discussions to help shape the future of Codex.

</CardGroup>

## When PRs Are Invited

The Codex team may invite an external contributor to submit a pull request when:

- The problem is well understood
- The proposed approach aligns with the team's intended solution
- The issue is deemed high-impact and high-priority

<Info>
  The most valuable contributions consistently come from community members who demonstrate deep understanding of a problem domain. That expertise is most helpful when shared early through detailed bug reports, analysis, and design discussion in issues.
</Info>

## Why This Policy?

In the past, the Codex team accepted external pull requests for bug fixes. While we appreciated the effort and engagement from the community, this model did not scale well.

Many contributions were made without full visibility into:
- Architectural context
- System-level constraints
- Near-term roadmap considerations

Reviewing and iterating on these PRs often took more time than implementing the fix directly, and diverted attention from higher-priority work.

**We focus external contributions on discussion, analysis, and feedback**, and reserve code changes for cases where a targeted invitation makes sense.
