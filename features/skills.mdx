## What are Skills?

Skills are modular, self-contained folders that extend Codex's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge.

### What Skills Provide

Skills can include:

1. **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## How Skills Work

Skills use a three-level progressive disclosure system to manage context efficiently:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Metadata (name + description)">
    Always loaded in context (~100 words). This helps Codex determine when to use the skill.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SKILL.md body">
    Loaded when the skill triggers (less than 5k words). Contains instructions and workflows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bundled resources">
    Loaded as needed by Codex. Scripts can be executed without reading into context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Skill Structure

Every skill follows this structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
├── agents/ (recommended)
│   └── openai.yaml - UI metadata for skill lists
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation loaded as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, etc.)
```

### SKILL.md (Required)

The main skill file consists of:

- **Frontmatter (YAML)**: Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are critical—Codex reads them to determine when to use the skill.
- **Body (Markdown)**: Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded after the skill triggers.

<Note>
The description in the frontmatter is the primary triggering mechanism. Include both what the skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.
</Note>

### Bundled Resources (Optional)

</CardGroup>

## Installing Skills

Skills are stored in `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (typically `~/.codex/skills/`).

### System Skills (Built-in)

Codex comes with built-in system skills that are automatically installed to `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/` on startup. These include:

- **skill-creator**: Guide for creating effective skills
- **skill-installer**: Install skills from GitHub repositories

System skills are updated automatically when you update Codex.

### Installing Additional Skills

Use the built-in `skill-installer` skill to install additional skills:

<CodeGroup>
```bash List Available Skills
# In Codex, type:
/use skill-installer
"List available skills"
```

```bash Install a Skill
# In Codex, type:
"Install the [skill-name] skill"
```

```bash Install from GitHub
# Install from a GitHub repository:
"Install the skill from github.com/owner/repo/path/to/skill"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
After installing a new skill, restart Codex to pick it up.
</Note>

## Creating a Skill

Codex includes a built-in `skill-creator` skill that guides you through the skill creation process.

### Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load the skill-creator">
    ```bash
    /use skill-creator
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Describe your skill">
    Tell Codex what you want the skill to do and provide examples:
    
    "I want to create a skill for rotating and editing PDF files. Users should be able to say things like 'rotate this PDF 90 degrees' or 'extract text from this PDF'."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Let Codex create it">
    Codex will:
    - Plan the reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
    - Initialize the skill directory with proper structure
    - Generate SKILL.md with frontmatter and instructions
    - Create any necessary helper scripts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate and iterate">
    ```bash
    # Codex will run validation automatically
    scripts/quick_validate.py path/to/skill-folder
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Skill Creation Process

The skill-creator follows this workflow:

1. **Understand the skill** - Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used
2. **Plan reusable contents** - Identify scripts, references, and assets needed
3. **Initialize the skill** - Run `init_skill.py` to create the structure
4. **Edit the skill** - Implement resources and write SKILL.md
5. **Validate the skill** - Run `quick_validate.py` to check for issues
6. **Iterate** - Test on real tasks and improve based on feedback

## Skill Design Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share it with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

<Warning>
Default assumption: Codex is already very smart. Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Codex really need this explanation?"
</Warning>

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. When approaching this limit, split content into separate files:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Pattern 1: High-level guide with references
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

```markdown Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization
# BigQuery Skill

For domain-specific queries, see:
- **Finance metrics**: See references/finance.md
- **Sales data**: See references/sales.md
- **Product analytics**: See references/product.md
```
</CodeGroup>

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility:

- **High freedom** (text instructions): Multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context
- **Medium freedom** (pseudocode/parameterized scripts): Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
- **Low freedom** (specific scripts): Operations are fragile, consistency is critical

## Using Skills

### Automatic Triggering

Codex automatically loads skills based on the context of your request. The skill's `description` in the frontmatter determines when it triggers.

### Manual Loading

You can explicitly load a skill using the `/use` command:

```bash
/use skill-name
```

This ensures the skill is loaded for your current task.

## Managing Skills

### Disabling Project Docs

Skills can be disabled using:

```bash
codex --no-project-doc
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export CODEX_DISABLE_PROJECT_DOC=1
```

### Skills Location

Skills are installed to:
- **User skills**: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (typically `~/.codex/skills/`)
- **System skills**: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/` (auto-installed)

## Examples

### Example: PDF Editor Skill

A skill for PDF operations:

```yaml
---
name: pdf-editor
description: Edit and manipulate PDF files. Use when the user needs to rotate, merge, extract text, or perform other PDF operations.
---
```

Bundled resources:
- `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` - Rotate PDF pages
- `scripts/merge_pdfs.py` - Merge multiple PDFs
- `references/pdf_operations.md` - Advanced PDF manipulation guide

### Example: BigQuery Skill

A skill for querying a company database:

```yaml
---
name: bigquery-analytics
description: Query company BigQuery database for analytics. Use when the user asks questions about user metrics, revenue, or product usage data.
---
```

Bundled resources:
- `references/schema.md` - Database schema documentation
- `references/finance.md` - Finance and revenue metrics
- `references/product.md` - Product usage metrics

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep skills focused">
    Each skill should have a clear, single purpose. Don't create mega-skills that try to do everything.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test your scripts">
    Always test bundled scripts by running them to ensure they work correctly. Scripts should be deterministic and reliable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid duplication">
    Information should live in either SKILL.md or reference files, not both. Prefer reference files for detailed information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include only essential files">
    Don't create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or other auxiliary documentation. Skills should only contain information needed for the AI agent to do the job.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use clear naming">
    Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only. Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action (e.g., `rotate-pdf`, not `pdf-rotation-tool`).
  </Accordion>
