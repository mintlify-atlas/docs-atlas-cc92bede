description: Control Codex with special commands that modify behavior, manage state, and trigger specific features

## What are Slash Commands?

Slash commands are special commands that start with `/` and give you control over Codex's behavior. They're used to modify settings, manage conversation state, trigger specific features, and control the agent's workflow.

<Note>
Slash commands are entered in the Codex prompt and are processed before being sent to the AI model.
</Note>

## Available Commands

### Workflow Control

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/review - Code Review Mode" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Triggers a specialized code review of your changes.
    
    ```bash
    /review
    ```
    
    **What it does:**
    - Spawns a sub-agent with specialized review instructions
    - Analyzes your code changes for bugs, security issues, and maintainability problems
    - Provides structured feedback with priority levels (P0-P3)
    - Outputs an overall correctness verdict
    - Exits automatically when review is complete
    
    **Features:**
    - Uses dedicated review prompt and model
    - Can be configured with custom review model via `review_model` in config
    - Auto-approval enabled (no interruptions during review)
    - Web search and collaborative tools disabled for focused review
    
    See [Code Review](/features/code-review) for detailed usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/use - Load a Skill" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Explicitly load a specific skill for the current task.
    
    ```bash
    /use skill-name
    ```
    
    **Examples:**
    ```bash
    /use pdf-editor
    /use skill-creator
    /use bigquery-analytics
    ```
    
    This ensures the skill is loaded into context even if it wouldn't trigger automatically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/apps - Manage App Connectors" icon="plug">
    Lists available and installed ChatGPT app connectors.
    
    ```bash
    /apps
    ```
    
    Shows:
    - Connected apps (labeled as "connected")
    - Available apps that can be installed
    
    See [Apps & Connectors](/features/apps-connectors) for more details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Session Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/clear - Clear Conversation History" icon="trash">
    Clears the current conversation history while keeping configuration.
    
    ```bash
    /clear
    ```
    
    Useful when you want to start fresh without restarting Codex.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/reset - Full Reset" icon="rotate-right">
    Resets both conversation history and session state.
    
    ```bash
    /reset
    ```
    
    More thorough than `/clear` - resets all session state.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/model - Switch Model" icon="brain">
    Switch to a different AI model mid-conversation.
    
    ```bash
    /model gpt-4o
    /model o1-mini
    /model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    ```
    
    Changes the model for the current session without restarting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/approval - Change Approval Mode" icon="shield-check">
    Change the approval policy for the current session.
    
    ```bash
    /approval suggest
    /approval auto-edit
    /approval full-auto
    ```
    
    **Approval modes:**
    - `suggest` - Agent asks for approval on all file writes and shell commands
    - `auto-edit` - Agent can write files but asks before running commands
    - `full-auto` - Agent can write files and run commands (sandboxed)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/sandbox - Change Sandbox Mode" icon="lock">
    Adjust the sandbox policy for the current session.
    
    ```bash
    /sandbox read-only
    /sandbox workspace-write
    /sandbox danger-full-access
    ```
    
    See [Security & Sandboxing](/core-concepts/security) for details on each mode.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Information

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/help - Show Help" icon="circle-question">
    Display help information and available commands.
    
    ```bash
    /help
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="/status - Show Session Status" icon="circle-info">
    Display current configuration and session state.
    
    ```bash
    /status
    ```
    
    Shows:
    - Current model
    - Approval mode
    - Sandbox mode
    - Active skills
    - Session information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Slash Commands

### In the TUI

Slash commands are entered at the prompt:

```bash
> /review
> /use pdf-editor
> /model gpt-4o
```

<Note>
Press `Tab` for autocomplete suggestions when typing slash commands.
</Note>

### In Scripts

You can pass slash commands in non-interactive mode:

```bash
codex exec "/review" --ephemeral
```

## Command Aliases

Some commands have shorter aliases for convenience:

| Command | Alias |
|---------|-------|
| `/review` | `/r` |
| `/clear` | `/c` |
| `/help` | `/h` |
| `/status` | `/s` |

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Commands

You can chain multiple commands in a single session:

```bash
> /clear
> /model gpt-4o
> /approval full-auto
> "Now refactor the authentication module"
```

### Commands in AGENTS.md

You can include default slash commands in your `AGENTS.md` project documentation:

```markdown
# Project Configuration

Always use the following settings:
- Model: gpt-4o
- Approval: auto-edit
```

This sets project-specific defaults without requiring manual slash commands each time.

## Creating Custom Commands

While Codex doesn't currently support custom slash commands, you can achieve similar behavior using:

1. **Skills** - Create a skill that triggers on specific phrases
2. **AGENTS.md** - Add project-specific instructions
3. **Aliases** - Use shell aliases to wrap common command patterns

### Example: Custom Workflow Alias

```bash
# In your shell config (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
alias codex-review='codex exec "/review"'
alias codex-fast='codex --model gpt-4o-mini --approval full-auto'
```

Then use:

```bash
codex-review
codex-fast "write unit tests"
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While not slash commands, these keyboard shortcuts work in the TUI:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation (press twice to quit) |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit Codex (press twice if needed) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete slash commands |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate command history |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen (not history) |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use /clear between unrelated tasks">
    Starting a new task? Use `/clear` to remove irrelevant context from the previous task. This helps Codex focus on what matters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configure approval mode per task">
    For exploratory tasks, use `/approval suggest` to review each action. For well-defined tasks in sandboxed environments, use `/approval full-auto` for speed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Explicitly load skills for complex tasks">
    If you know you need a specific skill, use `/use skill-name` at the start to ensure it's loaded, rather than relying on automatic triggering.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check /status when debugging">
    If Codex behaves unexpectedly, use `/status` to verify your current configuration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
