## What is the Codex SDK?

The Codex TypeScript SDK allows you to programmatically embed the Codex agent into your workflows and applications. It wraps the `codex` CLI from `@openai/codex`, spawning the CLI process and exchanging JSONL events over stdin/stdout.

With the SDK, you can:

- Start and manage conversation threads with the Codex agent
- Execute autonomous coding tasks programmatically
- Stream real-time events as the agent works (tool calls, file changes, responses)
- Get structured JSON output conforming to your schemas
- Resume previous conversations from persisted sessions
- Control sandbox modes, working directories, and approval policies

## When to Use the SDK

The TypeScript SDK is ideal for:

## Key Concepts

### Codex Client

The `Codex` class is the main entry point. It manages the underlying CLI process and configuration:

```typescript
import { Codex } from "@openai/codex-sdk";

const codex = new Codex({
  baseUrl: "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

### Threads

A `Thread` represents a conversation with the agent. Threads persist across multiple turns and are saved in `~/.codex/sessions`:

```typescript
const thread = codex.startThread();
```

### Turns

A turn is a single interaction where you provide input and the agent responds. Each turn can involve multiple tool calls, file changes, and reasoning steps:

```typescript
const turn = await thread.run("Fix the failing tests");
console.log(turn.finalResponse);
```

### Events

The SDK emits structured events as the agent works. Use `runStreamed()` to access these events in real-time:

```typescript
const { events } = await thread.runStreamed("Analyze this codebase");

for await (const event of events) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case "item.completed":
      console.log("Completed:", event.item);
      break;
    case "turn.completed":
      console.log("Usage:", event.usage);
      break;
  }
}
```
